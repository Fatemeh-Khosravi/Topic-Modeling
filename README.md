## ADS 509: Topic Modeling

Topic modeling is a fundamental text analysis technique since asking "What are these documents about?" is a fundamental question. In this assignment you will build an NMF model, an LDA topic model, and an LSA topic model. You will compare the resulting topic allocations. In this assignment we will work with the Brown University corpus in `nltk`. The documents are in categories already, so you can compare your models to the official classification as well.
